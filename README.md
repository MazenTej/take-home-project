I chose React as a framework to work on this project as I feel the most comfortable with it and it provides a lot of tools to handle data especially using hooks and functional components. I chose moment.js to format the dates as it makes it much easier to get the format you want. I chose material-ui for the design of this small app because it provides reusable components for creating tables that I felt were the easiest to map data to.
